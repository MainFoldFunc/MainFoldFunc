Program have some levels like this:
{
	" * * * * @ * * ** 
	 *###*###*
	*###&###*
}
Where:
- *  is a free space where you can move
- # is a blocked space where you can't move
-@ is an end of the level (exit)
-& is player

Player:
	Player can move up, down, right and left.
	He moves by entering up, down, right, left on to terminal
	if he goes to # cmd displays: you can go there
	If level ends (player got to the @ sign)
	cmd displayes: congrats you did this in x moves
	and asks to display another level.

Notes for 21.12:

Bugs:
When you select new level program ends
When you do a incorrect move next to the win it says you won

Something to add:
Systemzie it and make it more than one file (for good measure)
Maybe some enemies AI but it will be very hard (I will try it)
